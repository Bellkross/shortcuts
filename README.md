# ‚ö° Shortcuts - Lightning Fast Website Access

**Stop typing long URLs!** Create custom shortcuts and access any website instantly from Chrome's address bar.

[See examples](#examples)

## Installation

- Clone the repo via `/some/folder`
- Open `chrome://extensions/`, enable Developer mode, click `Load unpacked` and point to this folder.
- Once the extension is loaded, it will create `myshortcuts/search-engines` and `myshortcuts/shortcuts` folder in your bookmarks bar. So it can write bookmarks in those folders and read them as shortcuts.

- Search engines work with any site that has search URLs ending in `%s`
- Everything is stored locally - no data sent anywhere

## ‚ùì Need Help?

Want to edit/delete shortcuts?

- Go to Chrome bookmarks (`Ctrl+Shift+O`)
- Find the "myshortcuts" folder
- Edit or delete any shortcut/search engine there

Extension not showing?

- Check `chrome://extensions/` and make sure it's enabled

## Why not use search engines and site search feature by Chrome?

- Chrome does not allow to backup neither site search shortcuts nor search engines, so you will lose them if you switch to another machine
- This plugin allows you to backup your shortcuts and search engines as bookmarks, so you can easily restore them on any machine
- More customization options, like if you type "you" in the address bar and press enter while having "youtube" shortcut, it will go to your "youtube" shortcut URL, while chrome will initiate search for "you" in your default search engine
